  "shortDescription": "The entrance to Mur's fabled sewers. A dank labyrinth of twisting, brick-lined tunnels, home to strange creatures and forgotten secrets.",
  "longDescription": "An imposing iron grate, rusted and scarred with age, rests low to the ground in a shadowed alcove directly beneath the Murr's Town Center. The foul stench of waste and damp earth seeps up through the narrow gaps, mingling with the a strange metallic tang. The grate is secured with a heavy, crudely fashioned padlock, its surface pitted and green with verdigris. Scorch marks mar the surrounding cobblestones, and faint scratches hint at desperate attempts to pry the grate open. This is the fabled entrance to the Mur's Sewers. A labyrinth of dark tunnels that not only carry the town's refuse, but also whisper of forgotten catacombs, dangerous creatures, and lost treasure.",
